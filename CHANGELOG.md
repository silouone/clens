# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Renamed the npm package to `@silou/clens` (unscoped `clens` is refused by npm as
  too similar to `clean`); GitHub org stays `silouone`.

### Fixed
- **`clens web` now serves the dashboard in production mode from the npm artifact.**
  Server mode is an explicit `startServer({ mode })` parameter instead of an ambient
  `NODE_ENV` read: `bun build` constant-folded `process.env.NODE_ENV`, pinning the
  shipped bundle to development mode — which 404'd the dashboard UI and silently
  disabled the per-launch API token gate. The token gate is now enforced for the
  installed package.
- **`clens --version` and the `--help` banner report the real version.** The CLI
  now reads the version from the package manifest (inlined at bundle time) instead
  of a stale hardcoded `0.2.1` constant.
- **The published tarball ships `README.md` and `LICENSE`** (copied in by a `prepack`
  step), so the npm package page renders and the MIT grant travels with the code.
- **Running the CLI under plain `node` prints an actionable message** ("clens
  requires Bun — install it from https://bun.sh") instead of a cryptic `Bun.argv`
  stack trace.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-04

First public npm release. Builds on the 0.3.0 monorepo + web dashboard foundation
with an "instrument"-style dashboard redesign, richer session detail, cross-repo
mode, and a wave of distill-accuracy fixes.

### Added

#### Instrument Dashboard Redesign
- Reworked the web overview into an instrument-panel layout: `StatTile` and `Widget`
  primitives, a consolidated `HeroBand`, and data-driven widget composition
- Overview grid now hides empty/low-signal widgets behind an `archived_widgets`
  fold so solo and lightweight sessions stay uncluttered
- Sibling-tab rework: Backtracks / Timeline / Edits / Communication restyled for a
  consistent instrument aesthetic
- Session-detail v6 pass: tighter panel hierarchy, removed redundant nested
  scrollers, calmer typographic rhythm

#### Session Config / Environment Panel
- New per-session Config / Environment surface (git branch, commit, model, pricing
  tier, worktree) captured at hook time and rendered in `report`, `what`, and the
  web detail view
- `session-config` distiller expanded to aggregate MCP servers and settings context

#### Global Multi-Repo Mode
- `--global` across `list`, `distill`, `what`, and `web` aggregates sessions from
  every registered project
- `config --global-mode <repository|project>` controls discovery granularity
- New `session/global-read` module for cross-project session enumeration

#### Landing Page
- `landing/index.html` — static clens.dev marketing page (local-first messaging,
  dashboard screenshots, dark/light aware), zero external runtime dependencies

### Fixed

#### Distill Accuracy
- Narrative now leads with wall span and reconciles with the DURATION tile
  (span vs active no longer disagree)
- Duration/active-duration, pricing, and cost wiring corrected end-to-end
- Debugging-loop detection gate tightened; ghost sessions and torn last-lines handled
- Global analytics fallback and child-session live-filtering fixes

#### Web
- Auth token now persists across SPA navigation (no more prod-mode 401s after routing)
- Removed a redundant nested scroller in the session-detail tabs

### Changed
- Supervised dev launcher (`scripts/dev.ts` + `scripts/lib/`) is the sole port
  authority — picks free API/web ports, wires the Vite proxy, and group-reaps the
  entire process tree (incl. esbuild daemons) on Ctrl-C
- `bun run dev:doctor` reports and cleans orphaned dev processes

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Breaking Changes

#### Monorepo Migration
- Project restructured into Bun workspaces: `packages/cli` + `packages/web`
- All existing source moved to `packages/cli/src/`, tests to `packages/cli/test/`
- CLI package remains **zero runtime dependencies**
- Web package is a new `@clens/web` workspace with its own dependency tree

### Added

#### `clens web` — Browser-Based Session Explorer
- New CLI command: `clens web [--port <n>] [--no-open]`
- Opens a full-featured browser UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3700`
- Dynamic import of `@clens/web/server` avoids circular workspace dependency

#### Hono API Server (9 endpoints)
- `GET /api/sessions` — paginated session list with filtering and sorting
- `GET /api/sessions/:id` — distilled session detail (404/202 for missing/undistilled)
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/events` — raw events with LRU cache (10 sessions, ~17MB max)
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/conversation` — merged ConversationEntry timeline (paginated)
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/agents/:agentId/conversation` — agent-scoped conversation
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/diff/:filePath` — unified diff via diffLinesToUnified()
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/distill` — async distill trigger with SSE notification
- `GET /api/events/stream` — SSE with ring buffer replay (1000 events), 30s heartbeat
- `GET /` — SPA static assets with immutable cache headers (production mode)

#### Security
- Random 256-bit auth token per server session (query param or Bearer header)
- Bound to `127.0.0.1` only — no network exposure
- UUID regex validation on session IDs (path traversal protection)
- CORS: `localhost:5173` in dev, same-origin in production

#### SolidJS SPA
- **Session list**: table with status badges, duration, cost, branch; search, filters, pagination
- **Split-screen hero view**: ConversationPanel (left) + DiffPanel (right) with resizable SplitPane
- **ConversationPanel**: 6 entry types (user prompts, thinking blocks, tool calls, tool results, backtracks, phase boundaries); collapsible thinking with intent badges; consecutive tool call collapse; jump-to navigation; minimap scrollbar; virtual scrolling for 500+ entries
- **DiffPanel**: diff2html rendering, A/M/D/R badges, +N/-M line counts, expandable file cards, per-file lazy loading, abandoned edit markers
- **Bidirectional linking**: click tool call → scroll to diff, click file → scroll to tool call (flash highlight animation)
- **SessionHeader**: metadata bar with phase timeline visualization (click phase → scroll to boundary)
- **Bottom panel tabs**: Backtracks (click to scroll), Timeline (13 type filters), Edits (chain visualization), Communication (multi-agent)

#### Multi-Agent Views
- Agent tree sidebar for team sessions (collapsible, color-coded by agent type)
- Agent-scoped conversation view with stats sidebar (tools, cost, duration, files)
- Communication timeline: swim-lane visualization of inter-agent messages
- Solo session detection — no agent UI clutter

#### Risk Scoring
- `computeFileRiskScores()` — per-file risk based on backtracks, abandoned edits, failure rate
- Risk badges (green/amber/red) on DiffPanel file list with tooltips
- Risk levels: low (clean), medium (1-2 backtracks), high (3+ backtracks or >50% abandoned)

#### Plan Drift View
- Expected vs actual files side-by-side with match/missing/unexpected badges
- Drift score percentage with color coding

#### Live Updates
- `fs.watch` on `.clens/sessions/` and `.clens/distilled/` with 100ms debounce
- Per-file byte offset tracking for incremental JSONL reads
- SSE ring buffer (1000 events) with `Last-Event-ID` reconnect replay
- Polling fallback via `CLENS_POLL=1` env var
- Session list auto-updates with connection status indicator

#### Dark/Light Theme
- System preference detection as default, toggle in header
- Persisted in localStorage, flash-of-wrong-theme prevention
- All components support `dark:` variants

#### Keyboard Navigation
- `j`/`k` — scroll entries / session rows
- `Enter` — drill into session or agent
- `Escape` — go back
- `[`/`]` — switch panel focus
- `?` — keyboard shortcut help overlay

#### Responsive Layout
- Below 1024px: stacked layout (conversation above diffs)
- Above 1024px: side-by-side split (default)
- Error boundaries on every major panel with retry fallback

#### New CLI Modules
- `ConversationEntry` discriminated union type (6 variants)
- `buildConversation(distilled, events)` — pure function merging distilled data + raw events into sorted timeline
- `diffLinesToUnified(filePath, lines)` — converts DiffLine[] to standard unified diff format
- `computeFileRiskScores(distilled)` — per-file risk scoring (pure function, no I/O)
- `FileRiskScore` and `RiskLevel` types

#### Production Build
- Vite with SolidJS plugin, Tailwind CSS purging
- Asset fingerprinting with immutable cache headers (1 year)
- Output: 150KB JS (47KB gzip), 31KB CSS (6KB gzip)

### Changed
- `package.json` now uses Bun workspaces (`"workspaces": ["packages/*"]`)
- Root scripts: `build:cli`, `build:web`, `build`, `test:cli`, `test:web`, `test`, `dev:api`, `dev:web`
- `tsconfig.json` uses project references with shared `tsconfig.base.json`
- Hook tests updated with absolute paths for monorepo compatibility
- 1,373 CLI tests + 72 web tests = 1,445 total (0 regressions)

### Dependencies (web package only)
- Runtime: hono, solid-js, @solidjs/router, @kobalte/core, diff2html
- Dev: vite, vite-plugin-solid, tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer, vitest, @solidjs/testing-library

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-25

### Added

#### Tiered Hook Installation
- `clens init` now writes hooks to `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) instead of `.claude/settings.json` — no more polluting the repo
- `clens init --global` installs hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json` for all projects
- `clens init plugin` now installs both analysis tools AND capture hooks in one command
- `clens init --status` shows installation state across all tiers (Local, Global, Plugin, Legacy)
- `clens init --remove --legacy` removes hooks from `.claude/settings.json` (legacy location)
- Legacy detection: warns when hooks exist in `.claude/settings.json` and suggests migration
- Multi-tier deduplication warning when hooks are installed in multiple tiers
- `agentic/hooks/hooks.json` — plugin hooks file with all 17 hook events

### Changed
- `init()` refactored with `InitTarget` type (`"local" | "global"`) and `resolveInitPaths` helper
- `uninit` detects and removes hooks from all active tiers
- `installPlugin` merges capture hooks into user-level settings with backup
- `uninstallPlugin` removes capture hooks from user-level settings
- `validatePluginStructure` now checks for `hooks/hooks.json`
- `readSettingsFile` handles malformed JSON gracefully (try/catch)
- Type-safe parsing: replaced `as` casts on untrusted data with type guards
- 1137 tests across 49 test files (was 1086 across 48)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-25

### Breaking Changes

#### CLI Consolidation: 22 commands to 8
- **`uninit`** removed — use `clens init --remove`
- **`plugin`** removed — use `clens init plugin`
- **`stats`** removed — use `clens report` (default view)
- **`backtracks`** removed — use `clens report backtracks`
- **`drift`** removed — use `clens report drift`
- **`reasoning`** removed — use `clens report reasoning`
- **`tree`** removed — use `clens agents`
- **`agent`** removed — use `clens agents <id>`
- **`messages`** removed — use `clens agents --comms`
- **`decisions`**, **`edits`**, **`timeline`**, **`graph`**, **`journey`** removed — available in `clens explore` (TUI)
- Removed commands produce helpful suggestions (e.g., "'stats' was removed in v0.2.0. Did you mean 'clens report'?")
- Unknown flags now error with suggestions instead of being silently ignored

#### Renamed project from `agent-trace` to `cLens`
- CLI binary is now `clens`, hook binary is `clens-hook`, data directory is `.clens/`

### Added

#### New `report` command
- `clens report --last` — concise "what happened" summary with backtrack severity, high-risk files, top tools, agent workload
- `clens report --last backtracks` — backtrack analysis (with `--detail` for per-backtrack breakdown)
- `clens report --last drift` — plan drift analysis (with optional spec path)
- `clens report --last reasoning` — reasoning analysis (with `--full`, `--intent`)
- `clens report --last --json` — full DistilledSession JSON; `--json backtracks` for filtered output

#### Enhanced `init` command
- `clens init --remove` replaces `uninit`
- `clens init --status` shows hook count, plugin status, data stats
- `clens init plugin` absorbs all plugin management (`--remove`, `--dev`, `--status`)

#### Enhanced `agents` command
- `clens agents --last <id>` drills into a specific agent (by name, partial ID, or type)
- `clens agents --last --comms` shows communication timeline
- Solo session detection: prints "Solo session (no subagents)."

#### Flag Validation
- Unknown flags produce errors with suggestions (e.g., "Unknown flag --deep for 'report'. Did you mean 'clens distill --deep'?")

#### Deep Agent Observability
- `clens agent <id>` per-agent detail reports (tool usage, file maps, cost estimates)
- `clens graph` communication flow visualization between agents
- `clens explore` interactive TUI session explorer
- `clens distill --deep` for recursive distillation of subagent transcripts
- Active duration calculation — "29m active (10h59m wall)" in all outputs
- Agent tree building and enrichment with per-agent cost breakdown

#### Standalone Analysis Commands (now under `report`)
- Backtrack analysis with severity classification and hot file detection
- Decision point extraction (timing gaps, tool pivots, phase boundaries)
- Reasoning extraction from transcripts with intent classification
- Edit chain tracking with thinking-to-code binding
- Journey/lifecycle analysis for session progression
- Plan-to-execution drift analysis

#### Multi-Agent Pipeline
- Communication graph builder for inter-agent message flow
- Communication sequence extraction for ordered message timelines
- Cross-session aggregation for trend analysis
- Team metrics pipeline (decisions-team, summary-team)

#### Machine-Readable Output
- `--json` flag on all display commands for programmatic consumption

#### TUI Interactive Explorer
- Dynamic tab rendering: only tabs with data are shown (no empty Backtracks/Drift/Agents for solo sessions)
- Generic scroll support for all content tabs (overview, backtracks, decisions, reasoning, edits, drift, graph)
- Session list matches `clens list` layout: ID, Started, Branch, Team, Type, Distilled, Duration, Events, Status
- Terminal height-aware content clipping prevents overflow
- Keyboard shortcut hints shown per tab
- Decisions tab shows all decision points (not just 3)
- Reasoning tab shows all entries (not just last 10)
- Backtracks tab enhanced with timestamps, durations, error previews

#### Plugin System
- Agentic plugin with 5 skills, 3 slash commands, 1 agent
- `clens init plugin` for installation and management

### Fixed

#### TUI Data Pipeline
- Agent stats (tool calls, files, cost) now populated for multi-agent sessions via 3-layer fallback: time-range estimation, transcript enrichment, session event enrichment
- Active duration no longer shows "0ms active" for orchestrator sessions — falls back to wall duration
- Model detection chain extended: hook events → transcript → first agent model
- Parent session added to nameMap as "leader" — fixes full UUIDs in comm graph, messages, and graph tabs
- File map aggregation works for multi-agent sessions (edits tab no longer shows only reads)
- Token usage verified correct per Claude API semantics (input_tokens excludes cached; cache_read_input_tokens is separate)
- Agent workload in overview tab now populated from enriched agent stats

#### TUI Display
- Pluralization fix: "phase boundaries" not "phase boundarys"
- Agent lifetime bar labels truncated with ellipsis for consistent alignment
- Comm graph and messages tab truncate UUID-like names to 8 chars as fallback
- Git diff section in edits tab capped at 5 files for TUI compactness
- Token usage display shows total input with cached/uncached breakdown

#### P0: Debugging Loop Never Terminates
- Added termination conditions: 5-minute gap threshold, non-Bash interleave detection, 50-attempt cap

#### P0: Cost Estimation Is Fabricated
- Added `is_estimated` flag, display with `~` prefix and "(rough estimate)" label
- Extract real token counts from usage events when available

#### P1: Drift Score Is Broken
- Removed scalar score from `report drift` output; raw file lists (matched/unexpected/missing) are the primary signal
- Score retained in `distill` summary and TUI for at-a-glance orientation

#### P1: Path Normalization Hardcoded
- Replaced `KNOWN_ROOT_DIRS` with dynamic project-dir-based path stripping

#### P1: Active Duration Silently Inflated
- Pass raw unfiltered timing gaps separately from noise-filtered list

#### P2: Intent Classification Priority Bug
- Renamed `intent` to `intent_hint` to signal heuristic nature

#### P2: Silent Error Swallowing
- Added `.clens/errors.log` logging with timestamp and context

### Changed

#### Code Quality
- Readonly types throughout all type definitions and function signatures
- Type guards for runtime validation of parsed data
- Immutable patterns enforced: no `let`, no `.push()`, no loops — all new code uses `flatMap`/`reduce`/`filter().map()`
- 1086 tests across 48 test files
